Name: Dirk Geeroms
Subject: Physics (highschool)
- The proper work mindset
- His teaching style is a combination of self-study followed by a question hour on the material. What helped is that when explaining certain subject he always brings up stories related to the content, this brings more substance to the material which makes it more interesting to learn.
- He always pushes the students, making tests harder to make us work for our grades. This method, although not giving the best grades, does gives the feeling that you did learn something and that you worked for it.
